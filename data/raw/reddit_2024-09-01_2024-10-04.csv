2024-09-16 04:38:10,SecurityAnalysis,Best REIT investing resources?,"Hello, I'm a longtime fundamental investor, used to analyzing traditional companies. I'd like to branch out into REITs, which I've never really invested in outside of indices. I have some moderate real estate knowledge, and due to my time working in the public markets, I've accumulated a basic understanding of REITs. I guess you could say I've passed the REITs 101 class, and now I'm looking to continue my learning journey in the 102 class.

The problem is that I'm having a ton of trouble finding truly high-quality content teaching that ""2nd level"" of investing acumen. I'm wondering if you guys can recommend any books/podcasts/substacks/twitter accounts in the style of Ben Graham, Michael Mauboussin, Aswath, Greenblatt, etc. I'm essentially looking for the ""holy grail"" of REIT learning resources that can give me a deep understanding of the space before I start putting money at risk. Appreciate any recommendations. Thanks",10,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1fhwcia/best_reit_investing_resources/,"Best REIT investing resources?
